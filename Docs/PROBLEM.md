All the screenshoots are located in Docs directory in the root.

I was working on the last steps of the project when suddenly I got kicked out of the AWS server, and when I tried to connect again the Error appear (attached an image with the error in the Docs directory).

This is my github repo: https://github.com/AaIaSaHaA/Hosting-FullStack-Application-udagram.git
it is a little bit different from the project3.Zip file as I was still working on the project locally.
